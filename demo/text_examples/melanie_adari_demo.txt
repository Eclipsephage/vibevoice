Speaker 1: Hi Adari. Thanks for joining me. Today’s practice topic is Microsoft's new VibeVoice and how it turns simple text into friendly audio.
Speaker 2: Hi Melanie. Happy to be here as your AI co-host today and chat about how VibeVoice makes experimenting with audio feel easy.
Speaker 1: I'm excited too! But before we dive in, just a quick reminder that this isn't an official podcast - it's just an expirimental sandbox so I can hear how a back and forth might sound.
Speaker 2: Good call. Alrighty then, let’s start with the basics. You enter a line of text, I speak it, then you respond. That's the basic rhythm, right?
Speaker 1: You got it! And we can also pick different voices to keep our identities distinct. I'll keep mine calm and clear.
Speaker 2: And I'll take a friendly techy tone. Maybe a little curious too.
Speaker 1: So Adari, what do you think makes VibeVoice useful?
Speaker 2: Oh, let's see now. Well, I like that very long scripts are supported and we can bring long texts to life to really engage our audience. It helps ideas feel alive when you hear them in a podcast format.
Speaker 1: I agree. It's really hard to capture people's attention these days with important information. It seems audio is a way we can truly engage them in important topics.
Speaker 2: Exactly. And it's another way to repurpose content that already exists to breathe new life into it.
Speaker 1: 100 percent. Well Adari, what do  you say we wrap this one up and and see how it sounds? 
Speaker 2: Sounds like a plan, Melanie. Thanks for including me in your practice session. 
Speaker 1: Thanks for being here! Ta ta! 
Speaker 2: Toodles!
